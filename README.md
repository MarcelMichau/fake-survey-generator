## What is this?

This is a .NET | C# | React | TypeScript full-stack application of moderate complexity (not just a to-do app), used as a
playground for experimentation. Simply put: This is where I mess around with code. It is heavily inspired by
the [.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/)
book, as well as its companion reference
application [eShopOnAzure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopOnAzure). It also incorporates various
elements from different repos & blog posts which served as inspiration.

It is built using Vertical Slice Architecture principles with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and DDD (
Domain-Driven Design) thrown into the mix. It doesn't follow these principles to the letter, but provides a decent
example of how to apply the basics of these principles.

It is heavily centered around the
Microsoft [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) + [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) technology stacks as these are
what I have the most experience in & just like building things with. üòÄ

Here are some of the features incorporated into this project:

Some of the above features are relatively straightforward to implement, others have some intricacies that require some
Googling in order to set up. I just like to have them placed in the context of a complete working application to refer
back to when necessary.

## Why is this here?

I wanted something to try new things out on, without the risk of substantially endangering an actual production
environment used by actual people.

It was for this reason that I built the Fake Survey Generator (FSG) app as a way to test out tools, libraries, patterns,
frameworks & various other stuff.

It has a very simple domain: it generates surveys. Fake ones. They can be used as a tool for helping you decide what to
have for dinner, which book you should read next, where you should go for your next team lunch, or anything that tickles
your fancy.

This application is also used as a reference for configuring/wiring up some common things I sometimes forget how to do.
_Living Documentation_ if you will. You know the culprits: How do I wire up that database again? What is the syntax for
that logging configuration? How do I make thing A talk to thing B?

The domain is kept relatively simple such that it doesn't overwhelm the app with unnecessary complexity. It should be
quite easy to wrap your head around without requiring a degree in Computer Science.

I also felt that a lot of reference/demo/boilerplate projects out there cover the core application domain & don't go
into much detail around the building/deployment/hosting of final application. So this project aims to cover both. It
contains application code, configuration, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code needed to run the application, as well
as a live, running version of the application (as long as budget allows üòÅ). So this repo hopefully may contain something
for everyone & fill in the potential gaps across the whole spectrum of application development. It falls somewhere
between a template/boilerplate project & a real-world production open-source application.

### Common

The application is built for containers & .NET Aspire. For local development, the .NET Aspire App host is used when debugging the
application with Visual Studio/Rider.

The hosted version of the application is deployed here: https://fakesurveygenerator.mysecondarydomain.com

The following endpoints are accessible:

- [/openapi](https://fakesurveygenerator.mysecondarydomain.com/api-docs) - The OpenAPI documentation page for
  the API
- [/health/live](https://fakesurveygenerator.mysecondarydomain.com/health/live) - Health Checks endpoint used by Azure
  Front Door health probe
- [/health/ready](https://fakesurveygenerator.mysecondarydomain.com/health/ready) - Health Checks endpoint used by Azure
  Front Door health probe

The hosted version utilizes the following infrastructure:

- [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-apps/#overview)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/)
- [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/)
- [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/)
- [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)
- [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)
- [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/frontdoor/#overview)
- [Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) (for CI/CD)

## Authentication

The application makes use of [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) for authentication which is implemented
by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). Currently supported connections are:

- Auth0
- Google
- Microsoft

## How do I run this thing?

In order to run FSG on your local machine, you will need the following prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
- [Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 or higher](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

1. Open `FakeSurveyGenerator.slnx` in Visual Studio:

2. Ensure that the `FakeSurveyGenerator.AppHost` project is selected as the startup project

3. Hit `F5` to debug the application, or `Ctrl` + `F5` to run without debugging

4. The [.NET Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview) should
   open automatically
